# Crux

Android client for [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) servers with a native UI and broad feature coverage.

**Crux is an independently maintained fork of [OC Remote](https://github.com/crim50n/oc-remote)**, and is
not affiliated with or endorsed by the OC Remote project or its author. It is also an unofficial
community project, not affiliated with the OpenCode team.

Crux is the mobile half of [crux.casa](https://github.com/polats/crux.casa), a control plane that
provisions hosted OpenCode servers. Any OpenCode server works — crux.casa is not required.

## Why Crux

- **Work from anywhere** — use OpenCode through a mobile-first native chat or a full interactive terminal
- **Stay connected** — manage multiple remote servers or run OpenCode directly on-device through Termux
- **Keep projects organized** — search, favorite, categorize, reorder, share, export, and revisit sessions across servers
- **Use the complete workflow** — stream responses, inspect tool output and context usage, attach files, answer questions, approve permissions, and run session actions without falling back to a desktop
- **Make it yours** — choose from 15 locales, flexible themes including AMOLED, and detailed chat, connection, notification, and image controls
- **Operate reliably** — atomic settings import, deduplicated connections, configurable recovery, diagnostics, completion notifications, large-session safeguards, and cryptographically verified in-app updates

## Features

### Native UI
- **Full chat interface** — native Material 3 UI with GFM markdown, code blocks, task markers, strikethrough, scrollable tables, syntax highlighting, and copy actions
- **Message streaming** — real-time text streaming with auto-scroll
- **Smart scroll behavior** — manual scroll disables auto-scroll; automatically re-enables when scrolled to bottom
- **File mentions** — `@file` autocomplete with server-backed path search and quick insert
- **Workspace files** — browse project folders, preview highlighted text, Markdown, and images, and download files without leaving the chat
- **Attachment support** — send images, PDFs, text, source code, and configuration files from device storage
- **Android sharing** — share one or multiple supported files into an existing or new chat on a connected server
- **Tool outputs** — expandable tool-call cards with selectable monospace output
- **Image preview & save** — open sent, draft, and Markdown images in a fullscreen viewer with pinch zoom, pan, double-tap zoom, and device saving
- **Shell output copy** — bash output blocks support text selection and one-tap copy (command + output)
- **HTML error fallback modes** — switch long HTML error payloads between rendered page view and raw code view
- **Collapsible reasoning** — reasoning expands on demand, with optional auto-expand and turn dividers for multi-message responses
- **Slash commands** — `/new`, `/fork`, `/compact`, `/share`, `/rename`, `/undo`, `/redo`, `/shell`
- **Message actions** — long-press user messages to revert with confirmation
- **Reliable delivery** — outgoing prompts stay visible with queued state while delayed server events and history are reconciled
- **Retry control** — connection retry errors and countdowns stay visible while Stop remains available to abort the pending run
- **Interaction queue** — simultaneous permissions and questions stay ordered with position, retry, parent-chat routing, and permanent-approval confirmation

### Terminal Mode
- **Termux-like terminal mode** — full-screen terminal UI with dedicated extra keys and mobile-first interactions
- **Server-scoped terminal tabs** — tabs are shared across sessions for the same server and managed from a drawer
- **PTY over WebSocket** — low-latency interactive I/O for CLI/TUI apps
- **Reliable PTY resize** — rows/cols update with viewport changes and IME transitions
- **TUI rendering improvements** — better full-grid rendering behavior for terminal UIs
- **Terminal shortcuts** — Ctrl/Alt latching, volume-key virtual modifiers (Ctrl/Fn), and `Ctrl+Alt+V` paste
- **Selection toolbar paste** — terminal selection menu includes paste action integrated with terminal input
- **Mobile navigation and recovery** — inertial scrollback, pinch zoom, explicit connection states, reconnect for transient failures, and in-place restart for exited tabs
- **Terminal guidance and keys** — optional panel-opening guidance, repeating arrow keys, and server-controlled cursor visibility, blink, and shape

### Session Management  
- **Multi-session** — switch between sessions, view history
- **Project browser** — search sessions, optionally group them by project, and start chats from 5–50 configurable recent directories
- **Session organization** — favorite and reorder important sessions across servers, filter Favorites by reusable custom categories, and keep offline favorites visible until their server reconnects
- **Session actions** — create, reload, fork, compact, run a code review, share/unshare, rename, and delete via explicit menus
- **Terminal mode shortcut** — open the current session in terminal mode from the chat top bar
- **Fast history loading** — show the newest 10 messages first, preload the configured 25–200 message target in the background, and load older pages on demand
- **Large-session stability** — configurable response limits, disk-backed processing, cached message images, oversized-payload fallback, and smaller-page OOM recovery
- **Session export** — export full session as JSON file with streaming progress notification
- **Multi-select in sessions** — long-press to enter selection mode, select multiple sessions, and delete in one action
- **Draft persistence** — input text, image attachments, and @file mentions saved per session; survives navigation, app restart, and WebUI detours
- **Read-only subagents** — child-agent sessions expose their history and context without unsafe prompt or shell controls

### Model & Agent Selection
- **Model picker** — search providers and models, follow server ordering, select model variants, and manage model visibility without leaving chat
- **Agent selector** — tap to cycle through agents; each agent colored with its TUI theme color (blue, purple, green…)
- **Reliable agent mode persistence** — explicit Plan/Build choice is preserved correctly between UI state and sent commands
- **Provider icons** — 74 vector icons for AI providers shown in model picker and next to assistant responses
- **Token usage** — displays total tokens and cost in toolbar subtitle
- **Context window details** — color-coded usage indicator with input/output/reasoning/cache, session totals, remaining capacity, and cost
- **Compact layout** — horizontally scrollable toolbar prevents overflow on long translations

### Localization
- **15 locales** — English (source), Russian, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese (BR), Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese (Simplified), Ukrainian, Turkish, Arabic, Polish
- **Localization workflow** — locale files are maintained with `lokit` during development
- **Settings** — language and theme selection in Settings screen

### Settings
- **Language** — 15 locales (system default, English, Russian, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese BR, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, Chinese Simplified, Ukrainian, Turkish, Arabic, Polish)
- **Reconnect mode** — aggressive (1–5s), normal (1–30s), or conservative (1–60s) backoff strategy
- **Background WakeLock** — optionally keep screen-off SSE delivery active continuously, or reconnect after device wake and network changes
- **Theme** — light, dark, or system default
- **Dynamic colors** — Material You dynamic color support (Android 12+)
- **AMOLED dark mode** — pure black surfaces with accent borders across chat bubbles, cards, menus, dialogs, and input blocks (works with both static and dynamic colors)
- **Chat font size** — small, medium, or large text in chat messages and code blocks
- **Code word wrap** — toggle horizontal scrolling vs. word wrap in code blocks and tool outputs
- **Compact messages** — reduce spacing between messages for denser layout
- **Auto-expand tool results** — show tool card contents expanded by default
- **History preload target** — configure how many recent messages to load per session after the newest 10 appear (25–200)
- **Recent directories** — choose how many projects appear in the quick new-session dialog (5–50, default 20)
- **Reasoning display** — optionally auto-expand reasoning and show dividers between messages in one response
- **Confirm before send** — optional confirmation dialog before sending messages
- **Haptic feedback** — optional direct vibration with configurable duration, amplitude, and an immediate test action
- **Keep screen on** — prevents sleep while the chat screen is open
- **Notifications** — toggle task completion notifications
- **Silent notifications** — suppress sound and vibration for task notifications
- **Image optimization controls** — tune max image side (keep original or 720–2560 px) and WebP quality for attachments
- **Diagnostics** — inspect privacy-sanitized application logs by severity, then copy, share, or clear them without ADB
- **Settings sync** — synchronize preferences, remote servers, categories, assignments, Favorites, and hidden models through GitHub Gist, WebDAV, or a file selected from a compatible Android document provider such as Google Drive; connection settings are retained separately, server passwords can be encrypted, and conflicts and periodic background sync are supported while local runtime configuration remains device-specific
- **Secure in-app updates** — automatic daily discovery plus manual checks from About; GitHub Release APKs are downloaded in-app, verified by SHA-256, package/version, and signing certificate, then handed to Android's system installer

### Connection
- **Multi-server** — connect to multiple OpenCode servers simultaneously
- **Local runtime via Termux** — set up and run OpenCode directly on-device from the Home screen (setup/start/stop/sessions)
- **Local runtime launch options** — configure LAN binding (`0.0.0.0`), optional server username/password auth, background launch mode, auto-start (background-only), startup timeout, and proxy/`NO_PROXY` from the app
- **Provider OAuth flow** — browser OAuth, headless fallback handling, and provider-state refresh on resume
- **MCP management** — inspect configured MCP server status, connect or disconnect servers, retry failures, and launch OAuth authentication from per-server settings
- **SSE event stream** — real-time session status, permissions, questions
- **WebSocket transport** — used for terminal PTY streams
- **Auto-reconnect** — exponential backoff starting at 1s, with max delay based on reconnect mode (5s/30s/60s)
- **Background service** — foreground service keeps connections alive when app is minimized

## Requirements

- Android 8.0+ (API 26)
- OpenCode server accessible over the network

## Setup

1. Start the OpenCode server with network access:

```bash
opencode serve --port 4096 --hostname 0.0.0.0
```

2. In the app, tap **+** and enter the server URL (e.g. `http://192.168.0.10:4096`), username, and optional password.

3. Tap **Connect** on the server card.

## Building

### Android Studio

1. Open the project
2. Sync Gradle
3. Run on a device or emulator

### Command line

```bash
# Build debug APK
./gradlew assembleDebug

# Install on connected device
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk

# Or: stamp the version onto the launcher icon, build, install and launch in one step
python3 scripts/device.py
```

`scripts/device.py` burns the version into the launcher icons before the build and restores them
afterwards, so the home screen shows which build is on the phone without opening the app, and the
working tree stays clean. `python3 scripts/stamp-icon.py --restore` undoes a stamp left behind by
an interrupted build.
